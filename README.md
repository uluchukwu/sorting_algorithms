# ALX 0x1B.C - Sorting Algorithms & Big O Project

## Overview

This project is a part of the ALX Software Engineering program's 0x1B.C curriculum, focusing on Sorting Algorithms and Big O notation. The purpose of this project is to implement various sorting algorithms in C programming language and analyze their time complexity using Big O notation.

## Sorting Algorithms Implemented

The project includes implementations of the following sorting algorithms:

- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Quick Sort
- Merge Sort

Each sorting algorithm is implemented in its respective source file and is accompanied by comments explaining the algorithm's logic and operation.

## Files Structure

- `0-bubble_sort.c`: Contains the implementation of the Bubble Sort algorithm.
- `1-insertion_sort_list.c`: Implementation of the Insertion Sort algorithm for singly linked lists.
- `2-selection_sort.c`: Implementation of the Selection Sort algorithm.
- `3-quick_sort.c`: Implementation of the Quick Sort algorithm using the Lomuto partition scheme.
- `100-shell_sort.c`: Implementation of the Shell Sort algorithm.
- `101-cocktail_sort_list.c`: Implementation of the Cocktail Shaker Sort algorithm for doubly linked lists.
- `README.md`: This file - provides an overview and instructions for the project.

## How to Use

To use the sorting algorithms implemented in this project:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the source files using a C compiler (`gcc`, `clang`, etc.).
    Example:
    ```
    gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic *.c -o sorting_algorithms
    ```
3. Run the compiled executable `sorting_algorithms`.
4. Follow the instructions or integrate the sorting functions into your own C programs by including the respective header files and calling the sorting functions as needed.

## Big O Analysis

Each sorting algorithm's time complexity has been analyzed using Big O notation and is documented in the comments within the source files.
